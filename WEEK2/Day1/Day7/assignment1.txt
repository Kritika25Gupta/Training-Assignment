1. What is The Viewport?
   Viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. To take control over the viewport, <meta> tag is used.
   SYNTAX of <meta> tag:
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
   This tag is used for giving the browser instructions on how to control the web page's dimensions and scaling.
  
   width=device-width:set's the width of the page according to the device's screen.
   initial-scale=1.0: sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded.
   USES: Before tablets and mobile phones webpages were designed for computer only and they had a fixed and static
   design but later on when the new devices were introduced, fixed we pages were too large to fit the viewport and 
   therefore the tag is used to scale down the entire web page according to the device.
