1. a. What is MVC and MVVM?
   b. What is Single Responsibility Principle?

a) The full form MVC is Model View Controller.In this architecture, a component is built to handle specific 
development aspects of an application. MVC separates the business logic and presentation layer from each other. 
This architectural pattern mainly used for desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
The full form of MVVM is Model–View–ViewModel. The view model of MVVM is a value converter that means that it is
view model’s responsibility for exposing the data objects from the Model in such a way that objects are easily
managed and presented.
b)The Single Responsibility Principle is the first principle of SOLID principles. It is the fundamental principle 
of object-oriented programming that determines how we should design classes.The Single Responsibility Principle 
states that:Each software module should have one and only one reason to change.
In other words, a class should have only one responsibility and therefore it should have only one reason to change
its code. If a class has more than one responsibility, then there will be more than one reason to change the class

2.  What are keys in React JS? How keys are involving  in array processing?
A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements in React. Keys are used 
in React to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted. In other words, we can say that keys
are used to give an identity to the elements in the lists.Example:
const numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
const updatedNums = numbers.map((number)=>{
return <li key={index}>{number} </li>;
});
