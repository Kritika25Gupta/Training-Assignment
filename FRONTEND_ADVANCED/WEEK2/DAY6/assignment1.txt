1. How to add / remove events dynamically without using event attributes (eg:  onclick, ...)
The built-in method addEventListener() allows you to attach an event listener to an HTML element. It accepts two 
parameters:
The event type to listen to and the callback function to run when the event is triggered:
        Element.addEventListener(type, callbackFn);
The event type to return to and the callback function to run when the event is triggered:
        Element.removeEventListener(type, callbackFn);
