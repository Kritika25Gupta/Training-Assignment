1. How to add events to html elements at runtime using javascript?
   There are two common ways to attach event to the elements:
a)Using Element Attributes: Attributes are extension to the HTML elements. They provide extra functionality to the
  elements. Eg:
        <p>
          <button  id ="btn" onclick="btnClick();"> Click Button </button>
        </p>
In the above example you can see we have added onclick event attribute to the button element.
b) Use addEventListener function to attach an event attribute to an element without adding attribute to the 
   element directly. Eg:
        <p>
          <button id ="btn2">Click Button</button>
        </p>
addEventListener takes two parameters, first is an event name and second is a function which will do the action.

2. How to use keypress, keyup, keydown events?
keydown: This event is triggered when a key is pressed down.
keypress: This event is triggered when a key is pressed. This event fails to recognise keys such as tab, shift, 
ctrl, backspace etc.
keyup: This event is triggered when a key is released.
The onKeyDown, onKeyPress, and onKeyUp events can be used to detect these events respectively.
