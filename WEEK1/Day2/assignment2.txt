2. Why do we use  ~  and >  symbols in css selectors?
   The symbol '~' is a general sibling combinator. It selects all the elements after the element and the symbol '>'
   is applicable only for the Direct child of the container. 
   div ~ p: Here ~ symbol selects every <p> element that is preceded by a <div> element
   div > p: Here > symbol selects all <p> elements where the parent is a <div> element
